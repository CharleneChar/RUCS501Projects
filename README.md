## RU CS501 Projects :clipboard:
Hello there!\
This repository holds my programming projects done during the period of Rutgers University CS501 course - Math for Data Science.


### :pushpin: Project Objectives and Execution:
* Homework 1 
It approximates a square root of a D x D square matrix.
To see the results,
  1. Clone this repository (PS you may follow the command below) \
  `git clone https://github.com/CharleneChar/RUCS501Projects.git`
  2. Execute the main.py under Homework_1 directory (PS you may follow the command below) \
  `python3 Homework_1/main.py`

* Homework 2
It achieves two things. One approximates a solution to a quadratic function expressed in matrix form with different descent method. The other solves a constrained problem of maximizing a polynomial function such that an inequality is satisfied with branch and bound algorithm.
To see the results,
  1. Clone this repository (PS you may follow the command below) \
  `git clone https://github.com/CharleneChar/RUCS501Projects.git`
  2. Execute the main.py under Homework_2 directory (PS you may follow the command below) \
  `python3 Homework_2/main.py`

* Homework 3
It achieves two things. One calculates probability of whether a party will win in an election (where there might or might not have gerrymandering). The other calculates probability from joint distribution.
To see the results,
  1. Clone this repository (PS you may follow the command below) \
  `git clone https://github.com/CharleneChar/RUCS501Projects.git`
  2. Execute the main.py under Homework_3 directory (PS you may follow the command below) \
  `python3 Homework_3/main.py`
